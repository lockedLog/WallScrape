# WallScrape
Widely known web3 researcher x.com/zachxbt announced a bounty on scraped info for a handful of websites. I was able to successfully scrape most of the data he wanted for one of the websites. Produced over 100,000 unique lines in a minute or two running. By now means a clean or perfect program, but it is very much functional. Threw this together in under an hour.
